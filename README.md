# Monster Questionnaire

To know if you are a monster [pass my test](http://ibitoye-monsters.ossystem.ua/)

## Authentification details

There are 3 accounts you can log in with

1. Email: monster@gmail.com  Password: fcRa012ad
2. Email: monster2@gmail.com Password: fcRa012ad
3. Email: monster3@gmail.com Password: fcRa012ad

> All users were created using Auth0 and they were also added to my MySQL database with their unique Auth0 id if in case statistics needs to be gathered about 

## Extra feature added

I added a try again button to allow users answer multiple time and test how sending of the results by email works. I needed this while I was developing it so I decided to add it.

## Further improvement

I also wanted to add a log out functionality but didnt cause of time constraints. However to test with different users you will need to delete the `access_token` and `expires_in` in your local storage this will take you to the authorization page when you reload.
